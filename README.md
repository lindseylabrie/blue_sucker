# Blue Sucker Fecundity 
Lindsey LaBrie (University of South Dakota), repository began 8/30/2021

Field data collected by Tanner Carlson (University of South Dakota) and BJ Schall (South Dakota Game Fish and Parks), March 2021. Lab data collected by L. LaBrie, T. Carlson, and B. Schall, March 2021.

## What is fecundity?
The total number of eggs (ova) that are likely to be laid in a spawning season by a female.

## Methods: 
40 male and 40 female Blue Suckers were harvested near the James and Missouri River confluence during trammel netting in Spring 2021 (during Spring spawning runs) and brought back to the SDGFP lab. Weight and length data were collected. Gonads were removed and individually weighed to the nearest gram. 3 one-gram egg samples were taken from the posterior, middle, and anterior region of each ovary. The three counts were averaged and then multiplied by the weight of the entire ovary to get an estimated number of eggs in each ovary (gravimetric method).

## Challenge: 
Can we use weight, length, weight + length as predictors of fecundity? Which distribution offers the best predictions--gamma, lambda, etc?
